Actual prices are displayed in the App and in the App Store at the time of purchase and may vary by region and currency.

Auto-Renewal

	•	After cancellation, you will continue to have access to premium features until the end of the current billing period.

Credits
	•	The App may offer consumable credit packs which can be used for additional usage beyond included plan limits (for example when GPU/usage limits are reached).
	•	Credits are consumed as they are used and are non-refundable once delivered, except where required by applicable law.

Free Trials & Promotions
	•	Any free trial or promotional offer, if available, will be clearly displayed in the App.
