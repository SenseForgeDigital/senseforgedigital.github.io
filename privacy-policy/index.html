7. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures—encryption, secure storage, access controls—to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. No system is 100 % secure, so we encourage you to protect your device and credentials.

8. Third-Party Services

The App uses several third-party services to deliver, host, and enhance its functionality. Each provider processes data according to its own privacy policy and terms of service. We select partners who apply appropriate security and privacy standards, but we encourage you to review their policies for full transparency.

Services We Use

Grok (AI model provider) – powers text-based conversational and personalization features within the App. User input may be processed securely to generate AI responses.

Supabase – provides our backend infrastructure for user authentication, database management, and storage.

Railway – provides cloud hosting and deployment for the App’s server components.

ElevenLabs – processes text-to-speech audio generation to deliver realistic voice interactions.

Apple In-App Purchases (IAP) – enables subscription management and secure payment processing within the App, governed by Apple’s payment and privacy policies.

Each of these services may collect limited technical or usage data (such as API requests, timestamps, or device metadata) required for functionality, diagnostics, and security.

We do not control and are not responsible for the data handling practices of these third parties.

9. International Transfers

Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where applicable, we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure adequate protection (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses).

10. Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or store personal data from anyone under 17. If you believe a minor has used the App, contact us at connect@aibuiltbetter.com and we will promptly delete the data.
